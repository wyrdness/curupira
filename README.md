## Overview

The Curupira is a powerful forest guardian spirit from Brazilian indigenous Tupi folklore, depicted as a child-like figure with bright red hair covering its entire body and distinctive backwards feet that face the opposite direction from its travel. This characteristic makes the Curupira impossible to track, as its footprints lead pursuers in the wrong direction.

The Curupira protects the forest and its animals, punishing hunters who kill excessively or show disrespect to nature, while helping and rewarding those who hunt respectfully and honor the forest. Its methods include creating illusions, whistling to confuse hunters, and leading them in circles until they become hopelessly lost.

The Curupira rides a peccary (wild pig) and commands forest animals. It drives disrespectful hunters mad or leads them into danger, but guides respectful hunters to safety and good hunting.

The Curupira represents indigenous wisdom about environmental protection and the importance of living in balance with nature. It has become a symbol of Brazil's environmental movement and indigenous cultural heritage.
